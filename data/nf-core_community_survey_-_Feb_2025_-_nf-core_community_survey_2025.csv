Yes, they are maintaining Nextflow and providing many resources for free (such as the containers), but are also clearly imposing some changes on the community with business interest in mind. Of course, other companies could contribute as well (and are not doing it much), but the dominance of Seqera (considering how many leading nf-core people are on their payroll) is clearly unhealthy from a community aspect.","Develop a sustainability strategy. What I mean by that: The incentives for developing a pipeline and getting it into nf-core are high. A new pipeline can be published, and nf-core creates exposure and provides a solid base to build on. However, like with every open source project, the maintenance is tedious, but usually not very glamorous. For some of the biggest nf-core pipelines, the lead developers have essentially resigned and taken over new tasks. That is fair. But it is also a problem, because whoever fills that gap can hardly write a new paper. The same goes for those that maintain the website or tools.

While I don't use the pipelines themselves that much, the modules are subworkflows are great additions to many of the projects I work with, and they really do speed up the development process. The latest template changes that allow greater granularity for inclusion/exclusion of various template parts is great, and I think continuing in this vein is the way to go: keep doing great pipelines with the nf-core standards, but facilitate people working with the nf-core tooling to make non-nf-core pipelines of their own.
