Developer,"I think, there are some good policies in place. I like that collaboration on pipelines is enforced, rather than just being a pipeline repository collecting multiple different workflows for the same task.","Admittedly Nextflow. Why couldn't you build the same great community around a Pythonic workflow system? Also, I see the role of Seqera quite ambivalent. Yes, they are maintaining Nextflow and providing many resources for free (such as the containers), but are also clearly imposing some changes on the community with business interest in mind. Of course, other companies could contribute as well (and are not doing it much), but the dominance of Seqera (considering how many leading nf-core people are on their payroll) is clearly unhealthy from a community aspect.","Develop a sustainability strategy. What I mean by that: The incentives for developing a pipeline and getting it into nf-core are high. A new pipeline can be published, and nf-core creates exposure and provides a solid base to build on. However, like with every open source project, the maintenance is tedious, but usually not very glamorous. For some of the biggest nf-core pipelines, the lead developers have essentially resigned and taken over new tasks. That is fair. But it is also a problem, because whoever fills that gap can hardly write a new paper. The same goes for those that maintain the website or tools. I do not have a solution to that, but the problem will only get more pressing the older nf-core gets, so it would be good to start addressing it.","Community structure, Collaborative policies","Commerical Interests, Nextflow itself",Better sustainability,"We like Nextflow...? You can write new papers (but need more examples), fair enough better passing on docs"

Developer,Collaborative programming & learning from experienced developers,"The large and perhaps sometimes excessive amount of rules or good practices. This makes nf-core good, but not always easy for new members.","Would love to one day have within nf-core tools to be able to run standalone module (or subworkflows) pipelines - similar to bactopia

ie. `nf-core module run fastp -input `samplesheet.csv` -args '--trim_x ... ' -args2 'some_more_custom_args' -pipeline custom/repo/of/pipeline ` 
The custom/repo/of/pipeline is important for reproducibility purposes
I believe this will make nf-core pipelines appeal to a much wider applications. Also, the meta.yml files  can be used with nf-schema to validate the input samplesheet.

"User, Developer","Setting opinionated standards and frameworks for bioinformatic pipelines, including developer tooling. These kinds of things allow me to use nf-core content in non-nf-core pipelines, which makes all the content of nf-core a huge asset for bioinformatics at large.","While the opinionated standards previously mentioned are great, them being opinionated also means that they are not always perfect for all situations, which is fine. I have experienced, however, that it can be difficult being heard while voicing new ideas or changes to the standards, and I get the feeling that the standards are held close in the core team's hands. This is, in general, a good thing (i.e. having a core team with a clear vision), but I do feel the communication could become better - saying why a change is deemed bad/undesired, for example, rather than letting the discussion fade away in Slack.","The nf-core community and all its content really is amazing! While I don't use the pipelines themselves that much, the modules are subworkflows are great additions to many of the projects I work with, and they really do speed up the development process. The latest template changes that allow greater granularity for inclusion/exclusion of various template parts is great, and I think continuing in this vein is the way to go: keep doing great pipelines with the nf-core standards, but facilitate people working with the nf-core tooling to make non-nf-core pipelines of their own. I feel that the modules really are the best part of nf-core overall, and allowing them to be used in external pipelines really does contribute immensely to bioinformatics at large.","Collaborative policies, Template consistency, Modularity/sharing of components","Communication, Overly strict standards",No feedback,
